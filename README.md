Lubuntu installation on cheap Qilive Q9 windows 10 tablet

Q9 tablet specs:
https://www.auchan.fr/qilive-tablette-tactile-avec-clavier-10-1-w10-866311-noire-32go/p-c915897
Not too bad for 80 Euro (discounted price for a returned unit).


Installation was impossible from the iso burned on the USB key until the tablet was connected to external HDMI monitor. Lubuntu as other distributions I tried would get me only a grey screen probably due to the 800x1200 native resolution of the tablet's screen.
