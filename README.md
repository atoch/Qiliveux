Lubuntu installation on cheap Qilive Q9 windows 10 tablet

Q9 tablet specs:
https://www.auchan.fr/qilive-tablette-tactile-avec-clavier-10-1-w10-866311-noire-32go/p-c915897
Not too bad for 80 Euro (discounted price for a returned unit).

This tablet is distributed by Auchan in France. It is not clear if Auchan manufacture it or if it is a white chinese brand. What is certain is that there is no support, no web site, customer service when contacted directs you to the shop you purchased the tablet. Too bad.
